# fractaljs
A Mandelbrot Set fractal generator implemented using shaders in WebGL.

***Zooming is currently limited by the 32 bit precision of floats in WebGL. I attempted to emulate double precision without success; even though there are many sources on how to do this I couldn't find any examples of it working in WebGL.***
